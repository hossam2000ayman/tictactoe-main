One thing to note is that this game is, first and foremost,
a sample. As such, it MUST stay relatively straightforward
and simple. A real game, in contrast, would care much less
about straightforwardness and simplicity of the code,
and much more about gameplay, features, and things
like MAU.

For example, if this was less of a sample and more of
an actual game, I would go ahead and add internationalization.
It would be really easy to add in the case of this game.
But it would also make the sample murky, and internationalization
isn't what developers are coming here to learn.

In other words: let's keep it simple.
